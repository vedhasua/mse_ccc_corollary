### The script: 
`test_ccc_to_mse_mapping.py`
### Deals with: 
CCC to MSE mapping
### What it does: 
Reaffirmation of the formulations presented in section3.
* Please feel free to change the gold standard sequence (i.e. `GoldSeq`), the error set (i.e. `ErrData`), or to modify order of errors coefficients (`p1r_Err`) to cross-check the findings presented in the paper. 

##

### The script: 
`test_ccc_minmax_at_mse.py`
### Deals with: 
CCC maximisation and minimisation when given a fixed MSE
### What it does: 
Reaffirmation of the formulations presented in section 4.
* Please feel free to change the gold standard sequence (i.e. `GoldSeq`), mean square error (i.e. `MSE`) the error set (i.e. `ErrData`) to cross-check the findings presented in the paper. 

##

### The script: 
`test_ccc_minmax_given_errorset.py`
### Deals with: 
CCC maximisation and minimisation when given a fixed set of errors
### What it does: 
Reaffirmation of the formulations presented in sections 9, 10, and figure 5 regeneration.
* Please feel free to change the gold standard sequence (i.e. `GoldSeq`), the error set (i.e. `ErrData`), or to modify order of errors coefficients (`p1r_Err` and `p2r_Err`) to cross-check the findings presented in the paper.
